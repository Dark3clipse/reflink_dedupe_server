# reflink_dedupe

`reflink_dedupe_server` is a FreeBSD utility for deduplicating files on filesystems that support copy-on-write reflinks. It efficiently finds duplicate files, replaces them with reflinks, and can optionally monitor directories for live deduplication.

> ⚠️ **Experimental software**: `reflink_dedupe` is in active development. While great care has been taken in ensuring the reflinking functionality cannot cause data loss, **use at your own risk**. The author is **not responsible for any data loss**.

## Purpose

This utility enables software based, retroactive deduplication. Do not use this utility if you want proactive deduplication at the filesystem level.

Examples when you would want to use this tool:
- You have an existing filesystem that supports reflinks but your duplicates are not reflinked. This can for example happen after you have migrated a zfs dataset using zfs send/receive.
- You have configured reflink support but your clients cannot create reflinks. For example, when exposing your zfs data with NFS, clients are not yet able to create reflinked copies when source and target span multiple zfs datasets. This tool can retroactively scan your data for duplicates and replace regular copies with reflinks.
- You do not have the RAM to enable zfs deduplication but want to save storage space by making use of reflinks without requiring clients to use specific copy instructions in order to utilize reflinking functionality.

## Features

- **Indexing**: Scan all files under a deduplication root and store metadata in a SQLite database.
- **Duplicate detection**: Find duplicate files based on their content hash.
- **Reflink deduplication**: Replace duplicates with copy-on-write reflinks.  
  > Note: Your filesystem must support reflinks. You can provide a custom command for creating reflinks if a simple `cp` is not sufficient.
- **Live monitoring**: Watch directories and subdirectories within the deduplication root for changes and automatically deduplicate new or modified files.
- **Multi-threading**: Perform deduplication in parallel for faster processing on large datasets.
- **Statistics collection**: Track the number of reflinks created and the total space saved (in bytes).
- **Conflict management**: In the unlikely event of conflicts, they are renamed and added to a list for manual repair.
- **Dashboard**: A dashboard is rendered providing clear overview of what tasks are running.
- **Reporting**: After each execution a concise report is generated and stored for later reference.

```
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
cat <<EOF> /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/mediarr.conf
mediarr: {
  url: "https://static.mediarr.org/freebsd-repo",

```{sh}
sudo make install WITH_WATCHER=yes
```

```{sh}
sudo make install WITH_ZFS=yes
```

## Usage

```
Usage:
  reflink_dedupe [options]...

Options:
      -o, --oneshot         Run full deduplication on the configured root and exit.
      -d, --daemon          Run in daemon-mode. Does not immediatelly start deduplicating, but rather waits on an external trigger for scheduling.
      -w, --watcher         Enable fs watcher to react to incoming fs events.
      -i, --interactive     Show an interactive overview screen.
          --print-args      Print command arguments and exit.
          --print-config    Print configuration and exit.
          --schedule        Schedule an execution now. Another instance must be running in daemon mode for this to work.
      -h, --help            Show help options.
      -V, --version         Print program version.
```

### Run in oneshot mode

To run the utility once and perform full deduplication of the specified deduplication root (in the config file):

```
reflink_dedupe --oneshot --interactive
```

### Run as a daemon

To configure your system to run the daemon automatically at boot (recommended):

```
echo 'reflink_dedupe_enable="YES"' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.conf
```

To start the daemon immediatelly:

```
sudo service reflink_dedupe start
```

> Note: make sure to configure your cron job schedule here: `/usr/local/etc/cron.d/reflink_dedupe.cron`.

## Configuration

`reflink_dedupe` uses the configuration file located at `/usr/local/etc/reflink_dedupe.conf`.

Lines beginning with # are comments. The default configuration contains sections for general settings, logging, operation modes, and watcher settings.

- Modify DEDUPLICATION_ROOT to the root of the directory tree you want to deduplicate.
- REFLINK_CMD should create a copy-on-write reflink; defaults to cp.
- THREADS controls multi-threading.
- WATCH_PATHS and watcher settings are used if live monitoring is enabled.
